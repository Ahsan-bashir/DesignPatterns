# Adapter Pattern 

The Adapter Pattern is a software design pattern that allows you to make incompatible interfaces work together. Imagine you have two different tools or systems that don't speak the same language. The adapter acts as a translator, converting the requests of one system into a format that the other system understands.

## What it is

- **Making things work together**: Allows existing classes to be used with new interfaces without modifying their source code.
- **Flexibility**: Provides a way to adapt different functionalities to a common interface.

## Pros

- **Improved reusability**: Existing classes can be reused in new contexts with minimal changes.
- **Loose coupling**: Promotes loose coupling between components, making them easier to maintain and test.
- **Flexibility**: Adapters can be easily extended to support new functionalities.

## Cons

- **Increased complexity**: Introducing adapters can add complexity to your codebase.
- **Performance overhead**: Depending on the implementation, adapters might introduce some performance overhead.
- **Potential for confusion**: Multiple adapters for similar functionalities might lead to confusion.

## Practical Examples

- **Electrical Plugs**: Different countries have different plug standards. Adapters allow you to use a device from one country in another by converting the plug format.
- **Chargers**: Many devices use a standard USB port for charging, but older devices might have different charging ports. Adapters convert the new format to work with the older device.
- **Media Players**: A media player might only support a specific format like MP3. An adapter can convert other formats (like WMA) into MP3 for the player to understand.
