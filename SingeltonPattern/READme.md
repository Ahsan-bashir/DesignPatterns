# Singleton Pattern Implementation

This project demonstrates the Singleton pattern in C#.

## What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.

## Benefits

- Guaranteed single instance
- Global access
- (Optional) Lazy initialization

## Drawbacks

- Tight coupling
- Dependency injection difficulty
- Overuse potential

## When to Use

Consider the Singleton pattern for:

- Global state management
- Resource pooling
- Cache implementation

## Alternatives

- Factory pattern
- Dependency injection
- Configuration management

## Usage Example

This project includes a `Singleton` class that demonstrates how to create a single instance. You can access this instance through the `GetInstance()` method.

See the source code for implementation details.
